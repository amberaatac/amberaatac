Fusion energy, often referred to as the next big source of renewable energy, has the potential to revolutionize our world. It's a form of power that could provide us with a nearly unlimited supply of energy while producing minimal waste and emitting no greenhouse gasses. However, even after achieving multiple successful nuclear ignitions, the path to achieving this goal is still complete.

The first major challenge is the technical difficulty of creating a fusion reaction. While it has been done and repeated, the conditions and the price point for these ignitions to happen are costly. Since fusion reactions occur when atomic nuclei come together to form a heavier nucleus, releasing vast amounts of energy in the process, this only happens under conditions of extreme heat and pressure, similar to the conditions that are produced on stars. Replicating these conditions on Earth, in a controlled and safe manner, in a way that can be commercialized requires the implementation of new technologies to make it more efficient.

Another significant challenge is the issue of materials. The reactor components must be able to withstand extreme temperatures and intense radiation. Finding materials that can endure these conditions for a long time, without degrading or breaking down, is challenging. Ensuring that these reactors keep developing and remain active for a long time, requires diligent effort on the part of scientists and engineers to create systems that can be developed and deployed quickly and safely.

While fusion is much cleaner than fission, it's not completely without waste. Fusion reactions produce some radioactive waste, which needs to be managed and disposed of safely. Although the waste from fusion is less long-lived than that from fission, this still presents a significant challenge, especially considering the long-learned lessons from nuclear reactors and their respective wastes.

The cost of building a fusion reactor is high, and it's still an ongoing process to make fusion energy economically competitive with other power sources. Additionally, due to public opinion of nuclear power and the associations that come with it, fusion faces a lot of regulatory scrutiny, which can cause delays and increase costs.

The goal is to make fusion energy the main source of power generation to win the race of climate change. However, with these challenges still present it is important to not focus on this one aspect but to widen the range of options that can be provided by other forms of energy. By that, we wonâ€™t depend on the regulation and development of fusion energy to slow down or stop climate change. The promise of a nearly limitless, clean source of power is too great to ignore. However, it is important to have backups as the timeline of when this energy source can be deployed varies and climate change will not wait on us.
