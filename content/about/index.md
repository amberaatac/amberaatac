I am an aspiring particle physicist with an interest in working on and developing research surrounding fusion energy as well as quantum computing. Additionally, I have experience in astrophysics and neurobiology research. 

I am currently expanding my knowledge of computer science and working to apply it to my future research as a physicist, which you will see as my portfolio develops. My hobbies include exploring every library I can, learning about philosophy, and getting lost. Reach out to me if you would like to ask me anything!
